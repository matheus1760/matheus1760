Hi, welcome to my profile!
I am Matheus Bione, a Brazillian future developer. I have knowledge in Linux administration, C and C++. I will soon start CS, looking into that.
Currently colaborating in any projects which I can help with my experience, and  looking for help with literally everything, that would be awesome.
How to reach me: mathenbiolis@gmail.com. Fun fact: I have a Shar Pei dog, He has many wrinkles
