I'm a CS student, and I really love it. Here I seek to **contribute** in academic and life changing projects ðŸ”­ 

## ðŸ“š My skills:

- One of the first programming languages I learned.

- My main OS. I've been using linux since 2021, and I do not regret it. 
- Currently I use Fedora, but I've also used Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Arch and even Gentoo!
- I have knowledge in cli, package management. and that was possible thanks to Gentoo.

- I love this language, seriously. I felt power in my hands while programming in it. 
- Learned a lot of OOP concepts, like interfaces, polymorphism, inheritance and... design patterns.
- I also learned a little bit of Kotlin, but too little to mention it here.

- My first and favourite programming language.
- Thank's to It I've learned arduino and got interested in CS.
- The majority of my projects (right now) are written in C
- I hope to learn a lot more about it and about the low-level programming world (rust, C++ and maybe assembly)
